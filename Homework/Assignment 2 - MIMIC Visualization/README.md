Develop 5 figures as your visual gallery based on MIMIC demo data using Tableau/Python: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/

Rationale: the goal of this assignment is to get familiar with the data structure of EHR data, including patient, diagnosis, admission, medication and so on. It also shows what kinds of simple statistics we can draw from these datasets. AI in health starts from data. This is the data we are going to analyze using machine learning or deep learning methods to derive valuable outputs for risk prediction and better care. This assignment will help us know the details of the EHR data.

Please submit:

- A Tableau/Pygthon file,
- Powerpoint slides to show details on how you build these visualizations (with the goal that other students can follow and rebuild your gallery).

PS: if you want to use python for this assignment, it is fine. You need to submit: python code, and powerpoint slides

Rubric:

- using exactly the same data and same figures from the tutorial, you will get 5 points
- using the same data and the same visual styles, but analyzing different topics, you will get 8 points
- using different TABLES (.csv files) within the MIMIC dataset with the same visual styles, and analyzing the same topics, you will get 9 points
- using different TABLES (.csv files) within the MIMIC dataset with different visual styles, and analyzing different topics, you will get 10 points
- if you add some novel data analysis or use a different visualization package (such as d3.js), you will get 10 points + 1 bonus point.
